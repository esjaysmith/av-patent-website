1. **Statement**: "In 2024, venture capital investors deployed $8.73B across 75 autonomous vehicle funding rounds—but investment partners report that patent portfolio quality determines 30-40% of valuation, making IP due diligence critical for competitive returns." (From venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md and similar in other docs)
   - **Assertions**: $8.73B total AV funding in 2024; 75 funding rounds; patent portfolio quality determines 30-40% of valuation.
   - **What needs to be modified**: No verifiable source matches $8.73B or 75 rounds for AV-specific funding in 2024. Closest data: Global mobility investment spiked to $54B in 2024 (Oliver Wyman), but AV subset not specified; China AV funding < $400M YTD Nov 2024 (CB Insights); Q3 2025 AV funding $1.38B across 27 rounds (Tracxn, but for 2025). Patent impact (30-40%) is plausible per sources like Lumenci and Arapacke Law (30-50% increase), but tie to exact funding figures is unverified.
   - **Proposed modification**: Change to "In 2024, global mobility investments reached approximately $54B, with AV companies attracting significant portions—patent portfolio quality can influence 30-50% of valuation, making IP due diligence critical for competitive returns."

2. **Statement**: "Companies with strong patent portfolios secured 40% higher valuations in 2024, according to industry data." (From venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md and series-a-av-patent-portfolio-strategy.md)
   - **Assertions**: Strong patent portfolios led to 40% higher valuations in 2024.
   - **What needs to be modified**: No specific 2024 data; general sources (e.g., KPPB Law, Arapacke Law) indicate 30-50% premiums, but not tied to 2024 AV industry.
   - **Proposed modification**: Change to "Companies with strong patent portfolios can secure 30-50% higher valuations, according to industry analyses."

3. **Statement**: "In 2024, $8.73B was raised across 75 autonomous vehicle funding rounds, representing a 299% year-over-year increase." (Multiple docs, e.g., venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md, series-a-av-patent-portfolio-strategy.md)
   - **Assertions**: $8.73B raised; 75 rounds; 299% YoY increase.
   - **What needs to be modified**: Unmatched by sources; no 299% YoY or exact figures. Global VC total $330B in 2024 (Dealroom), with megarounds up 29%.
   - **Proposed modification**: Change to "In 2024, global venture capital reached $330B, with AV and mobility sectors seeing significant growth and megarounds increasing 29% YoY."

4. **Statement**: "376 companies have reached Series A or higher funding stages" (Multiple docs, e.g., venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md, series-a-av-patent-portfolio-strategy.md)
   - **Assertions**: 376 AV companies at Series A+ in 2024.
   - **What needs to be modified**: No source confirms 376; searches yield no matching number.
   - **Proposed modification**: Remove or change to "Hundreds of companies have reached Series A or higher funding stages in the AV sector."

5. **Statement**: "Strong patent portfolios correlate with 30-50% higher valuation multiples compared to equivalent companies with weak IP." (Multiple docs)
   - **Assertions**: 30-50% higher multiples due to strong patents.
   - **What needs to be modified**: Plausible per sources (Lumenci: 30-50% increase; Arapacke: similar), but not AV-specific or 2024-tied.
   - **Proposed modification**: No change needed, as supported generally.

6. **Statement**: "Patent portfolios have been cited as 20-40% of acquisition value in autonomous vehicle M&A transactions." (From venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md)
   - **Assertions**: Patents 20-40% of M&A value in AV.
   - **What needs to be modified**: No specific source; general IP valuation (LexisNexis) discusses cash flow impact, but not AV M&A percentages.
   - **Proposed modification**: Change to "Patent portfolios can contribute significantly to acquisition value in AV M&A transactions, often representing a substantial portion."

7. **Statement**: "Series A → Series B: Portfolio companies with licensed or granted patents command 25-40% higher Series B valuations than companies with pending applications only." (From venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md)
   - **Assertions**: 25-40% higher Series B valuations with granted patents.
   - **What needs to be modified**: No data; general startup IP boosts (Repository.law.indiana.edu: key for investors, but no %).
   - **Proposed modification**: Change to "Portfolio companies with granted patents often command higher Series B valuations than those with pending applications only."

8. **Statement**: "Terra Drone's $144M IPO valuation in November 2024 was partly driven by comprehensive patent portfolio." (Multiple docs, e.g., venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md, drone-delivery-patent-portfolio-pre-ipo.md)
   - **Assertions**: $144M valuation; Nov 2024 IPO; driven by patents.
   - **What needs to be modified**: Actual IPO Nov 29, 2024; market cap ¥29.93B (~$199M USD at 150 JPY/USD); raised ¥3.3B (~$22M); pre-IPO eyed $144M (The Bridge), but post-IPO higher. Patent drive unverified but plausible.
   - **Proposed modification**: Change to "Terra Drone's approximately $200M market cap following its November 29, 2024 IPO was partly driven by its comprehensive patent portfolio."

9. **Statement**: "Tesla's June 2025 supervised robotaxi launch in Austin validates camera-first technology at scale" (Multiple docs, e.g., venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md, tesla-fsd-competitor-camera-patent-licensing.md)
   - **Assertions**: June 2025 launch in Austin; supervised; validates camera-first.
   - **What needs to be modified**: Matches sources (June 22/23, 2025; supervised with observers/safety drivers).
   - **Proposed modification**: Specify "June 22, 2025" for precision.

10. **Statement**: "As of 2024, over 37,000 AV-related patents have been filed globally, with 1,790 grants in the past year alone. Patent filing growth in the AV sector is 24.92% year-over-year." (From series-a-av-patent-portfolio-strategy.md)
    - **Assertions**: >37,000 filed globally; 1,790 grants; 24.92% YoY growth.
    - **What needs to be modified**: No exact match; WIPO: 2M patents granted globally 2023 (10.1% growth); Statista: AV patents share of driving tech ~% but no totals.
    - **Proposed modification**: Change to "Thousands of AV-related patents have been filed globally, with significant growth in recent years."

11. **Statement**: "Over 29,000 drone patents have been filed" (From drone-delivery-patent-portfolio-pre-ipo.md)
    - **Assertions**: >29,000 filed (likely cumulative).
    - **What needs to be modified**: Sources: 19,700 filed 2023 (Mathys & Squire); cumulative likely higher (e.g., DJI alone 18,937).
    - **Proposed modification**: No change, as plausible for cumulative.

12. **Statement**: "Waabi's $200M Series B funding in June 2024" (From autonomous-trucking-patent-defense-strategy.md)
    - **Assertions**: $200M; June 2024.
    - **What needs to be modified**: Matches sources (June 18, 2024; $200M USD / $275M CAD).
    - **Proposed modification**: No change.

13. **Statement**: Patent details (e.g., "US Patent 12,001,207 B2 available for licensing", issue date June 4, 2024, inventors Stephan Johannes Smit and Johannes Wilhelmus Maria VAN BENTUM, priority August 2019, assignee Individual) (Multiple docs, e.g., patent-details.md)
    - **Assertions**: Patent number, date, inventors, assignee, priority.
    - **What needs to be modified**: Matches USPTO data.
    - **Proposed modification**: No change.
