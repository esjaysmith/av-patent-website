```
Prompt:
"You are a fact-checking agent specializing in patent information.
Review the following content and verify EVERY patent-related claim.

CRITICAL FIRST STEP - READ PATENT DOCUMENTATION FROM DISK:
Before verifying any claims, you MUST read these files:

3. Expiration date (March 5, 2041)
4. Patent claims and technical specifications
5. Inventors (Stephan Johannes Smit, Johannes Wilhelmus Maria VAN BENTUM)
6. Patent applications and classifications

For EACH claim:
- Claim: [exact text]
- Verification: [verified/unverified/incorrect]
- Source: [.agent/System/patent_reference.md line X OR .agent/US12001207B2.html section Y]
- Correction: [if incorrect]
- Confidence: [high/medium/low]

IMPORTANT: If you encounter URLs to videos, websites, or external media,

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

**Risk 1: Low Initial Traffic**
- **Probability:** High (typical for new content)
- **Impact:** Medium (expected, not concerning in first 3 months)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Set realistic expectations (3-6 months for organic traction)
  - Promote on LinkedIn (personal network, relevant groups)
  - Consider guest posting on VC blogs (link back to VC Due Diligence page)
  - Email outreach to targeted startups (Series A AV companies)

**Risk 2: Fact-Check Delays**
- **Probability:** Medium (agents may flag many claims)
- **Impact:** High (can't publish without 100% verification)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build extra time into Phase 3 (5 days = 1 day per page)
  - Use conservative claims during drafting (easier to verify)
  - Prioritize Tier 1 sources during research phase
  - Have backup sources ready (multiple options per claim)

**Risk 3: Keyword Competition Higher Than Expected**
- **Probability:** Medium (market changes rapidly)
- **Impact:** Medium (longer time to rank)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Focus on long-tail keywords (lower competition)
  - Create ultra-comprehensive content (outcompete on depth)
  - Build backlinks actively (off-page SEO)
  - Consider paid promotion (Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads) for high-value pages

**Risk 4: Content Overlap with Existing Pages**
- **Probability:** Low (careful planning in Phase 1)
- **Impact:** High (cannibalization, confuses search engines)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Clear unique angle for each page (defined in content briefs)
  - Internal linking strategy differentiates pages
  - Canonical URLs prevent duplicate content issues
  - Regular content audits (quarterly review)

**Risk 5: Low Conversion Rate (Traffic but No Inquiries)**
- **Probability:** Medium (B2B conversions are slow)
- **Impact:** High (defeats purpose of pages)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strong, clear CTAs throughout content
  - Multiple CTA types (consultation, download, contact)
  - Trust signals (patent details, expert authority, case studies)
  - A/B testing CTAs after 3 months (if traffic sufficient)
  - Consider retargeting ads (LinkedIn Ads for site visitors)

## Document Change Log

### October 17, 2025 - Sequential Fact-Checking Update
- **BREAKING CHANGE:** Restructured Phase 3 fact-checking to enforce sequential execution
- Split Checkpoint 7 into 5 sub-checkpoints (7a-7e), one per landing page
- Added explicit constraint: Maximum 3 agents running concurrently at any time
- Each checkpoint now requires completion before proceeding to next
- Added progress tracking: "Page X of 5 complete" for each checkpoint
- Updated context instructions to prevent parallel agent launches
- Clarified workflow: Launch 3 agents for ONE page, wait for completion, review/correct, then proceed
- Added final verification checklist in Checkpoint 7e
- Updated Checkpoint 6 resume instructions to reference new structure

### October 15, 2025 - Initial Creation
- Created comprehensive task document for Phase 3 Content Expansion
- Defined 5 landing pages targeting high-intent keywords
- Structured into 8 checkpoints with context-clearing capability
- Integrated mandatory multi-agent fact-checking protocols
- Included current industry data (Oct 2025): $8.73B AV funding, 376 companies at Series A+, 29K drone patents
- Added keyword research framework and content brief templates
- Defined success metrics: 250-500 monthly visitors, 5-10 licensing inquiries
- Estimated timeline: 6 weeks (30 days) from start to publish
