# The Journey Behind US Patent 12,001,207

## A Vision for the Future of Autonomous Navigation

When vision-based autonomous navigation technology development began in the mid-2010s, autonomous vehicles were largely a futuristic concept for most people. The patent (US 12,001,207, with a priority date of August 2019 and issued in June 2024) resulted from research into end-to-end neural network approaches. The autonomous vehicle landscape has evolved, with robotaxis and autonomous delivery vehicles entering deployment, supported by advancements such as Tesla's FSD v12.

## Technical Approach: Vision-Based End-to-End Learning

The approach focused on vision-based, end-to-end deep learning for autonomous vehicles. This approach differed from the then-prevalent industry methods, which emphasized lidar-driven, sensor-heavy systems with detailed mapping and object classification.

The research addressed the question:

> How can an autonomous vehicle navigate, maintain its path, and avoid obstacles using vision alone, without dependence on detailed maps requiring frequent updates?

This question guided the research, development, and patent applications. The patent applications aimed to protect the intellectual property and associated innovations from the development process.

## Validation Through Industry Evolution

The development of Tesla's FSD v12, using camera-fed neural networks trained end-to-end, aligns with the early technical approach. Comparing this approach to challenges encountered by other companies, such as Cruise's operational suspension in late 2024 following substantial investment, demonstrates advantages of vision-first architectures.

## The Market Opportunity

Autonomy is primarily a software-based function, which can offer higher margins compared to hardware. An effective licensing model focuses on software providers through per-vehicle or subscription-based agreements.

### Market Scale and Growth Potential

Projections indicate growth in the autonomous vehicle market. Deployment examples, such as Tesla's FSD program involving hundreds of thousands of vehicles, show continued expansion. Industry projections vary depending on the definition of "autonomous vehicle," but suggest growth in vehicles with advanced autonomous capabilities in the coming decade.

Applications beyond passenger vehicles include light delivery vehicles in the autonomous delivery sector, commercial drones for inspection and delivery, and specialized robotics in humanoid and industrial contexts.

Camera-based approaches have demonstrated viability, with adoption occurring across various applications.

## Technical Achievement

### End-to-End Neural Network Architecture

The technology involves vision-based autonomous navigation. The system includes end-to-end training (images to vehicle controls), visual navigation via waypoints, map-independent operation without detailed mapping, and obstacle avoidance through free passage detection and uncertainty-based stopping.

**Architectural Foundation:**

- Imitation learning foundation (building on NVIDIA DAVE-2, 2016)
- Proprietary path planning via visual prompting and free passage detection with model uncertainty
- Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning integration (Schmidhuber et al., 2019-2022)

**System Capabilities:**

- Real-time autonomous navigation using camera inputs
- Adaptive decision-making based on uncertainty
- Remote teleoperation and data collection
- Continuous learning from data

A demonstration of the technology is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOWuOP-0nDE

The demonstration depicts an autonomous research vehicle navigating using vision-based controls, including path visualization and obstacle awareness.

## Why This Patent Is Available for Licensing

### The Regulatory Reality

The startup, which was self-funded, developed a business case in a rural area, obtaining customer commitments and local regulatory approvals. Challenges arose in obtaining final regulatory approval from the central government in the Netherlands. These challenges were due to the organization's limited size and resources.

### The Scale Challenge

Deep learning AI involves data collection and computational resources, often more than anticipated. The approach has shown technical viability, but the investment for commercial scale exceeds the organization's capacity.

**Key factors include:**

- Regulatory processes often involve larger organizations
- AI systems require scaled data collection
- Neural network training needs computational infrastructure
- Generalization across environments involves real-world testing

Regulatory and scale requirements rendered independent development unfeasible.

## What This Means for Licensees

These challenges may present opportunities for other organizations. Organizations with resources, scale, and regulatory experience may utilize the patented innovations.

### Potential Applications

**IP Protection**: Incorporate vision-based navigation methods into patent portfolios

**Competitive Positioning**: Address potential infringement in camera-first systems

**Defensive Coverage**: Develop IP as the industry moves toward vision-based methods

**Development Efficiency**: Use existing IP instead of new development

## Technical Approach Status

The patent is available for licensing, and vision-based, end-to-end learning is an approach for autonomous navigation.

The industry has shifted from skepticism about camera-only systems to validation of vision-first approaches. Market developments suggest that autonomy can be achieved without exclusive reliance on lidar, detailed maps, or sensor-heavy architectures.

### Technology Validation

The prototype showed autonomous navigation in real-world environments, obstacle detection and avoidance using vision, operation without detailed mapping, and architecture applicable to various uses.

These capabilities have been validated through development and real-world testing, not theoretical simulation.

## Looking Forward: Industry Developments

The autonomous vehicle industry is undergoing changes. The industry debates sensor fusion versus camera-only approaches, and systems like Tesla's FSD v12 indicate that camera-based architectures may be viable for autonomous navigation.

**Major trends in the market:**

- Shift from lidar-heavy to camera-first architectures
