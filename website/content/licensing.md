# Patent Licensing Opportunities

**US Patent 12,001,207** is available for licensing across multiple industries and applications. **[View Full Patent on Google Patents →](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12001207B2)**

We offer flexible licensing arrangements for companies developing autonomous vehicle and drone navigation technologies.

## Licensing options

### Exclusive licensing
<div class="patent-highlight">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Companies that want sole rights to the patented technology in a specific field or region.
</div>

An exclusive license gives you full control over implementation in your target market. Competitors can't access the same technology, and you get direct input on future patent family developments.

Typical exclusive licensees: automotive manufacturers building camera-based AV systems, air vessel navigation platform developers, and technology companies building autonomous navigation solutions.

### Non-exclusive licensing
<div class="patent-highlight">
<strong>Best for:</strong> Companies that want cost-effective access to the patent without lengthy negotiations.
</div>

Non-exclusive licenses offer lower upfront costs, flexible royalties, and faster access to patent rights. They can support freedom-to-operate considerations and help with market entry.

Typical non-exclusive licensees: AV startups, established companies expanding into autonomy, research institutions commercializing navigation work, and international companies entering US markets.

### Field-of-use licensing
License the patent for specific applications only:

- Consumer vehicles (personal AVs and driver assistance)
- Commercial transportation (delivery, logistics, freight)
- Aerial systems (commercial air vessels and aerial logistics)
- Industrial applications (warehouse automation, agriculture)
- Research and development (academic and corporate R&D)

### Geographic licensing
Licensing is currently available for:

- United States
- United Kingdom

## Licensing process

1. **Reach out** with your company background and intended use
2. We'll have an initial conversation about the patent and how it might apply
3. If there's mutual interest, we discuss technical details, licensing arrangements, and next steps

## Compensation structures

*Specific terms are negotiated per agreement. These are typical arrangements we discuss.*

### Royalty-based

- Standard royalties based on net product revenue
- Tiered royalties with volume-based discounts for large-scale implementations
- Milestone royalties tied to development targets

### Fixed-fee

- One-time licensing fees for specific fields or territories
- Fixed annual payments for ongoing patent access
- Hybrid structures combining upfront and royalty-based compensation

## Industry applications

*These are potential applications inferred from the patent's technical scope, not claims made in the patent itself.*

### Automotive

The patent's safety-determining module and camera-based methodology may be relevant to automotive safety development and camera-first AV systems. Specific standards compliance would need separate evaluation. Patent protection can also support technology validation in development processes.

### Drones and UAVs

The patent covers air vessels, potentially applicable to package delivery, inspection services, and other commercial operations. The safety-determining technology may be relevant to air vessel safety development, though specific certification requirements need separate evaluation.

### AI and robotics

The patent describes a modular camera-based navigation system with machine learning integration that can be integrated with autonomous platforms. Patent protection extends to March 2041.
