## Writing Tone & Style

**Tone:** Educational and authoritative, peer-to-peer (VC to VC), not condescending, sophisticated

**Voice:** Second person ("you", "your portfolio") to create direct connection with VC investors

**Style Guidelines:**
- **Educational Priority:** This is primarily an educational resource, not a sales page
- **VC-Appropriate Language:** Use investment terminology (valuation, due diligence, portfolio, exit multiples)
- **Practical Framework Focus:** Every section should provide actionable takeaways
- **Balanced Perspective:** Acknowledge we're patent holders, but maintain objective evaluation framework
- **Respect VC Expertise:** Don't over-explain basic VC concepts, focus on patent-specific knowledge

**Avoid:**
- Sales-heavy language ("Buy our patent assessment service!" - too pushy)
- Talking down to VCs ("Let me explain venture capital..." - condescending)
- Overly technical patent jargon (balance technical accuracy with accessibility)
- Making investment decisions for VCs ("You should always invest if..." - overstepping)
- Dismissing VCs without patent expertise (many VCs aren't patent experts—that's OK)

**Authority-Building Language Examples:**

**Good:**
- "As patent holders with deep AV industry knowledge, we've developed this framework..."
- "In our experience evaluating patents and working with VCs, we've found..."
- "This methodology has been refined through dozens of patent portfolio assessments..."

**Bad (Avoid):**
- "We're the world's leading patent experts" (overblown, undermines credibility)
- "VCs don't understand patents—let us educate you" (condescending)
- "You must use our patent assessment service" (pushy sales pitch)

</div>
```

### Comparison Tables (Red Flag vs Green Flag)
Use Bootstrap table classes for checklist-style content:
```markdown
<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Metric</th><th>Red Flag (Weak)</th><th>Green Flag (Strong)</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Total Patents</td><td><3 patents</td><td>10+ patents</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Granted vs Pending</td><td>100% pending</td><td>70%+ granted</td></tr>
    ...
  </tbody>
</table>
```
