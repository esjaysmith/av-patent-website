## Writing Tone & Style

**Tone:** Professional and strategic, CFO/General Counsel-appropriate, financial sophistication

**Voice:** Second person ("you", "your company") to create direct connection with pre-IPO decision-makers

**Style Guidelines:**
- **Financial Language:** Emphasize valuation, IPO preparation, investor confidence (CFO audience)
- **Timeline Focus:** Constantly reference 12-24 month IPO timeline and 18-36 month patent timeline conflict
- **Terra Drone Benchmark:** Use Terra Drone as consistent reference point (industry standard)
- **S-1 Disclosure Context:** Reference SEC filing requirements throughout (adds credibility)
- **Balanced Tone:** Acknowledge in-house development value, position licensing as complement (not replacement)

**Avoid:**
- Overly technical drone language (CFO audience, not engineers)
- Dismissive of in-house patent development (position as balanced approach)
- Overpromising IPO success ("This patent will guarantee $1B IPO" - unrealistic)
- Legal advice ("You must file S-1 with these patents" - suggest consulting counsel)
- Hyped language ("Revolutionary drone patent!" - maintain professional tone)

## Bootstrap Components to Use

### patent-highlight Box
Use for highlighting the camera-based safety patent for drones:
```markdown
<div class="patent-highlight">
  <h4>Camera-Based Navigation Patent for Drone Delivery IPO</h4>
  <p><strong>US Patent 12,001,207 B2</strong></p>
  <p>Dual-module camera-based navigation safety system (applicable to UAVs)</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Visual navigation + safety verification</li>
    <li><strong>Granted:</strong> June 2024 (current technology)</li>
    <li><strong>Expires:</strong> March 2041 (17+ years, well beyond IPO horizon)</li>
    <li><strong>Drone Applications:</strong> Package delivery, BVLOS operations, obstacle avoidance</li>
    <li><strong>Regulatory Value:</strong> Supports FAA BVLOS waiver applications</li>
  </ul>
  <a href="/patent-details.html" class="btn btn-outline-primary">View Drone Applications</a>
</div>
```

### Alert Callouts
Use for IPO preparation tips:
```markdown
<div class="alert alert-info">
  <strong>IPO Preparation Tip:</strong> Start patent portfolio strengthening 12-18 months before planned S-1 filing. This allows time for strategic licensing (immediate) and proprietary applications (18+ months to grant). Underwriters want to see granted patents, not just pending applications.
</div>
```

### Comparison Tables
Use Bootstrap table classes for timeline/cost comparisons:
```markdown
<table class="table table-striped table-hover">
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Portfolio Metric</th><th>Before Licensing</th><th>After Strategic Licensing</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Total Patents</td><td>6 granted, 2 pending</td><td>8 granted, 5 pending</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Visual Navigation Coverage</td><td>0%</td><td>30%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>IPO Readiness</td><td>Weak</td><td>Competitive</td></tr>
    ...
  </tbody>
</table>
```
