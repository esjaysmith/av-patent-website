# Patent Strategy for Autonomous Trucking with Camera Navigation

## Introduction: Patent Strategy in Autonomous Trucking Funding

Waabi's $200M Series B funding in June 2024 highlights the role of patent portfolios in autonomous trucking investments. The company's intellectual property in simulation, AI, and camera-based perception contributed to its valuation.

This approach is common in the industry. Venture capital firms often review patent portfolios, making them important for funding and deployment in autonomous trucking.

In 2025, autonomous trucking startups encounter:

- **Investor IP Scrutiny**: Series B and C investors typically review patent portfolios. Companies with fewer than 5-10 granted patents could experience valuation adjustments or investment hurdles.
- **Competitive Patent Positions**: Aurora, Waymo Via, and Tesla Semi have developed patent portfolios. Without defensive IP, startups may become acquisition candidates or face competitive challenges.
- **Liability & Regulatory Requirements**: Class 8 truck accidents involve higher liability compared to passenger vehicles. Patent-protected safety technologies can assist with NHTSA and FMCSA compliance and may affect insurance costs.
- **Fleet Economics**: Camera-based systems are estimated at $50K-$80K per truck, compared to $150K-$200K for LiDAR systems. For a 100-truck fleet, camera-based systems may result in cost differences of $10M-$18M over 5 years, with patent protection affecting technology choice viability.

This guide outlines patent strategy considerations for autonomous trucking companies. The guide addresses patent portfolio development for companies at various stages, including options compared to in-house development.

## Section 2: Why Trucking Startups Need Patent Strategy

### Investor Expectations Have Fundamentally Changed

The autonomous trucking funding landscape changed in 2024. Investors conducting Series B and C rounds now treat patent portfolio strength as a valuation driver equivalent to technology, team, and market opportunity.

**Case Study: Waabi's $200M Series B (June 2024)**

Waabi raised $200M Series B from Uber, Khosla Ventures, and others—a massive round that included prominent venture firms with deep autonomous vehicle expertise. This funding round wasn't driven by breakthrough real-world testing results; instead, investors explicitly valued Waabi's comprehensive patent portfolio covering:

- Simulation technology (unique to Waabi's development approach)
- AI and machine learning systems
- Camera-based perception architecture

The strategic implication is clear: investors view strong patent portfolios as indicators of technical defensibility and long-term franchise value. Weak patent positions trigger valuation discounts or investment rejection.

### Liability Concerns Require Proven Safety Technology

Autonomous trucking introduces unique liability challenges that make patent strategy critical:

- **Class 8 Accident Liability**: Accidents involving large trucks carry exponentially higher liability than passenger vehicles
- **Insurance Costs**: Insurance carriers scrutinize safety technology documentation
- **Patent as Evidence**: Patent portfolios demonstrate commitment to safety innovation
- **Regulatory Credibility**: NHTSA and FMCSA regulators review patent portfolios during safety assessment processes

**Real-World Impact**: Companies with comprehensive safety-focused patent portfolios may benefit from lower insurance premiums and faster regulatory approval timelines.

### Competitive Pressure from Tesla Semi

Tesla's camera-first approach to the Tesla Semi is reshaping the competitive landscape for autonomous trucking:

**Cost Advantage**

- Tesla Semi uses camera-only navigation (no expensive LiDAR sensors)
- Estimated cost advantage: $70K-$100K lower per vehicle vs. LiDAR-heavy systems
- This cost advantage translates directly to fleet deployment profitability

**Strategic Challenge for Competitors**

- If you can't match Tesla's camera-first economics, you can't win the commercial trucking market
- Traditional truck OEMs (Daimler, Volvo, Paccar) scrambling to match cost structure
- Startups need camera-based patents to either compete directly or credibly partner with OEMs

### Fleet Deployment Economics Demand Camera-Based Systems

For commercial trucking operations, fleet economics are paramount. The technology choice directly determines profit margins:

| System Type | Per-Vehicle Upfront | Annual Maintenance | 5-Year TCO |
|------|---|---|---|
| **LiDAR-Based** | $150K-$200K | $15K-$20K | $225K-$300K |
| **Camera-Only** | $50K-$80K | $5K-$8K | $75K-$120K |
| **Hybrid System** | $100K-$150K | $10K-$15K | $150K-$225K |

*Note: Cost estimates based on industry analysis and may vary by specific implementation.*

**Real Cost Impact**: For a 100-truck fleet, the choice between camera-based and LiDAR systems determines a difference of **$10M-$18M over 5 years**. This economic imperative explains why camera-first patents have become strategically essential.
