## What this patent covers

US Patent 12,001,207, issued June 4, 2024, describes an autonomous vehicle control system that uses deep learning and camera-based navigation with a built-in safety assessment layer. If your system navigates using cameras, runs confidence checks, or hands off to a remote operator when confidence drops, this patent is relevant to you.

<div class="patent-highlight">
<strong>In short:</strong> Deep learning control + camera-based navigation + safety confidence scoring + remote operator handoff. This is the architecture most camera-first AV companies are building toward.
</div>

### Coverage areas

- Camera-based guidance systems for autonomous vehicles
- Commercial and consumer drone navigation
- Machine learning navigation algorithms
- Confidence-based safety assessment with operator handoff

## Timing matters

Tesla's unsupervised FSD rollout and the broader shift toward end-to-end neural networks have accelerated the camera-first AV space. Regulators are paying closer attention to safety systems, and patent filings in this area are increasing. Licensing now, before the space gets more crowded, gives you a cleaner position.

A few things happening in the market right now:

- Tesla is scaling unsupervised FSD, and competitors need differentiated IP
- End-to-end neural network navigation is replacing modular pipelines
- NHTSA and international regulators are tightening autonomous safety requirements
- Camera-based perception is overtaking lidar in cost-sensitive applications
