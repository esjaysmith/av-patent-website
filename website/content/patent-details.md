# US Patent 12,001,207: Camera-Based Navigation Safety Technology

- **Patent Number:** US 12,001,207 — **[View Full Patent on Google Patents →](https://patents.google.com/patent/US12001207B2)**
- **Issue Date:** June 4, 2024
- **Inventors:** Stephan Johannes Smit, Johannes Wilhelmus Maria VAN BENTUM
- **Assignee:** Individual (self-owned)
- **Patent Family:** Based on US16/987,612 (granted as US12,001,207, expires approximately 2040); priority to NL 2023628; potential continuations and international filings
- **Technology Classification:** G05D1/00 (Vehicle control), B60W60/00 (Autonomous vehicle drive control), G01C21/00 (Navigation)

## Patent Abstract

The patent describes a system for controlling autonomous vehicles or air vessels (drones) that uses camera images, navigation modules, and machine learning to safely navigate predefined routes. The system receives destination inputs, generates navigation instructions, captures live camera images, and compares them to stored reference images. A key innovation is the safety-determining module that generates a "safety value" indicating whether navigation instructions can be safely executed. If safety thresholds are not met, the system can request human operator intervention, enabling the system to learn from training data and improve over time.

*For complete legal text and detailed claims, refer to official USPTO records.*
