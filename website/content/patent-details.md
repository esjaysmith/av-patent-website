## Patent Abstract

The patent describes a system for controlling autonomous vehicles or air vessels (drones) that uses camera images, navigation modules, and machine learning to safely navigate predefined routes. The system receives destination inputs, generates navigation instructions, captures live camera images, and compares them to stored reference images. A key innovation is the safety-determining module that generates a "safety value" indicating whether navigation instructions can be safely executed. If safety thresholds are not met, the system can request human operator intervention. The system accumulates and stores training data for future reference.

*For complete legal text and detailed claims, refer to official USPTO records.*
