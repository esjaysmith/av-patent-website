**REPLACE WITH:**
> "Venture capital funding increasingly favors camera-based autonomous vehicle approaches, reflecting growing investor confidence in vision-first architectures."

---

### 5. Fix VW-Mobileye Partnership Description

**FIND (Line 77):**
> "VW's partnership with Mobileye faces uncertainty as both companies reassess LiDAR-heavy strategies."

**REPLACE WITH:**
> "VW strengthened its partnership with Mobileye in 2024, developing Level 4 autonomous vehicles using a multi-sensor approach including cameras, LiDAR, and radar."

---

### 6. Fix NHTSA Requirement Language

**REPLACE WITH:**
> "NHTSA encourages autonomous vehicle developers to submit voluntary safety self-assessment reports"

---

### 7. Add Disclaimer to Tesla Cost Claim

**FIND (Line 65):**
> "Tesla's camera-first approach costs less than $1,000 per vehicle"

**REPLACE WITH:**

**REPLACE WITH:**
> "NIO, XPeng, and Li Auto all announced advanced ADAS systems and in-house autonomous driving chip development in 2024-2025"

---

## ADDITIONAL CONTENT CORRECTIONS

### Add Accurate Tesla Status Description

**Insert after Line 31:**

> Tesla's June 2025 Austin robotaxi service operates in a limited geofenced area with safety observers present in passenger seats who can intervene if needed. The service uses 10-20 vehicles, operates only during daytime and evening hours (6 AM - midnight), and is unavailable during inclement weather due to camera visibility limitations. While representing progress in Tesla's autonomous driving development, the system remains at SAE Level 2 automation, requiring continuous human supervision.

---

### Update FSD v14 October 2025 Reference

**Replace vague October 2025 references with:**

> In October 2025, Tesla released FSD v14 to early-access users, featuring a 10x neural network expansion and improved video processing capabilities. However, FSD v14 remains a Level 2 supervised system requiring constant driver attention, not the unsupervised Level 4 autonomy some anticipated.

---

## STATISTICS REQUIRING SOURCES OR REMOVAL

### Remove if No Source Available:

1. **Line 59:** "over 5 million vehicles on the road collecting camera data"
   - **Action:** Change to "millions of vehicles" OR provide specific source

2. **Line 108:** "$3 million to $10 million in legal fees"
   - **Action:** Add "estimated" qualifier OR provide specific source

3. **Line 172:** "40-50% USPTO rejection rate"
   - **Status:** VERIFIED - Keep as is

4. **Line 132, 298:** "30-50% acquisition premium"
   - **Status:** VERIFIED - Keep as is

---

## NARRATIVE ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED

### Current Problematic Framing:

> "Tesla's October 2025 launch of unsupervised FSD in Austin marks the definitive validation of camera-first autonomous vehicle technology"

### Revised Framing:

> "Tesla's ongoing development of camera-first autonomous driving technology, including the June 2025 Austin robotaxi pilot and October 2025 FSD v14 release, demonstrates progress toward scalable vision-based autonomy—creating both urgency and opportunity for competitors to strengthen their camera-based patent positions."

---

### Current Problematic Statement:

> "Tesla's Austin deployment settles the debate: camera-first autonomous driving is not just viable, it's the path to scalable, profitable autonomy."

### Revised Statement:

> "Tesla's camera-first approach demonstrates the viability of vision-based autonomous driving, though the path to full Level 4 autonomy remains under development for all industry participants."

---

## SECTIONS REQUIRING MAJOR REVISION

### Section: "How Tesla's Unsupervised FSD Validates Camera-First Technology in 2025"

**Issues:**
- Title implies unsupervised FSD exists (it doesn't)
- Claims Level 4 deployment (incorrect)
- Claims October 2025 launch (wrong month, wrong capabilities)

**Recommended New Title:**
"How Tesla's Camera-First Development Accelerates Industry Competition in 2025"

**Key Changes:**
1. Remove claims of unsupervised operation
2. Remove claims of Level 4 autonomy
3. Correct timeline (June robotaxi pilot + October FSD v14 release)
4. Acknowledge current limitations while maintaining competitive urgency narrative
5. Focus on trajectory and investment trends rather than false accomplishments

---

### Section: "The Competitive Landscape Post-Tesla FSD"

**Issues:**
- Builds on false premise of Tesla achieving unsupervised Level 4

**Key Changes:**
1. Reframe around Tesla's progress toward autonomy (not achievement of full autonomy)
2. Maintain discussion of GM Cruise, Ford Argo (verified)
3. Fix VW-Mobileye partnership description
4. Clarify Chinese EV maker announcements
