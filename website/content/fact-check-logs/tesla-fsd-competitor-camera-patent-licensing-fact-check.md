## DETAILED FACT-CHECK FINDINGS

### 1. TESLA FSD AUSTIN DEPLOYMENT - OCTOBER 2025

**Claim (Lines 29, 41, 535):** "Tesla's October 2025 launch of unsupervised FSD in Austin"

**Status:** ❌ **INCORRECT**

**Actual Facts:**
- Tesla launched robotaxi service in Austin on **June 22, 2025** (NOT October 2025)
- The service is **NOT Level 4** and **NOT unsupervised**
- Service operates with **safety drivers in passenger seats** who can intervene
- Service is limited to 10-20 vehicles in a geofenced area
- Operates only 6 AM to midnight in restricted downtown Austin areas
- Rides unavailable in inclement weather due to camera limitations

**Sources:**

- Note limited deployment scope (10-20 vehicles, geofenced area)
- Remove claims of "unsupervised" operation

---

### 2. LEVEL 4 AUTONOMY CLAIM

**Claim (Lines 31, 41):** "First Level 4 camera-only autonomous system deployed at scale"

**Status:** ❌ **INCORRECT**

**Actual Facts:**
- Tesla FSD remains **Level 2 autonomy** as of October 2025
- FSD v14 released in October 2025 is still "FSD (Supervised)" - NOT unsupervised
- Level 2 requires constant driver supervision
- Competitors Waymo and Mercedes have achieved Level 4; Chinese manufacturer BYD has reached Level 3
- Tesla has **not** deployed Level 4 at scale

**Sources:**
- Multiple industry sources confirm Tesla remains at Level 2
- Electrek: "Tesla releases FSD v14, first major update in a year" (October 2025)
- Engineering.com: "Tesla's Autopilot has remained stuck at Level 2 autonomy—requiring constant driver supervision—for a decade"

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Required Corrections:**
- Remove all references to "Level 4" deployment
- Clarify that Tesla FSD is Level 2 (supervised driving)
- Do not claim "first" or "deployed at scale" for Level 4 camera-only systems
- Acknowledge that Tesla has not achieved Level 4 autonomy

**Sources:**
- Electrek: "Tesla releases FSD v14, first major update in a year" (October 7, 2025)
- NotATeslaApp.com: "Tesla's 2025 FSD Roadmap"

**Confidence:** HIGH

**Notes:**
- While FSD v14 released in October 2025, it is NOT unsupervised or Level 4
- The landing page conflates FSD v14 release with unsupervised capabilities

---

### 4. TEN-YEAR CAMERA-FIRST VS LIDAR DEBATE

**Claim (Line 43):** "For nearly a decade, the AV industry debated camera-first versus LiDAR-heavy architectures"

**Status:** ✅ **VERIFIED**

**Actual Facts:**
- LiDAR technology began making headlines around 2016 for autonomous vehicles
- Spurred by DARPA Grand Challenge success a decade earlier (circa 2005)
- Tesla began camera-only push since early 2010s, intensified 2016 onward

**Claim (Line 108):** "Patent infringement litigation in the autonomous vehicle sector costs $3 million to $10 million in legal fees alone"

**Status:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY VERIFIED / REASONABLE ESTIMATE**

**Actual Facts:**
- Waymo vs. Uber settled for **$245 million** (2018)
- General patent litigation costs millions in legal fees
- Specific $3M-$10M range not directly verified for AV sector
- Range appears reasonable based on general patent litigation costs

**Sources:**
- Multiple sources document Waymo vs. Uber $245M settlement
- General patent litigation cost estimates align with millions in fees

**Confidence:** MEDIUM

**Notes:**
- Specific $3M-$10M range not independently verified

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### Temporal Context (Today is October 18, 2025):

- References to "October 2025" appear to anticipate events that haven't occurred as described
- FSD v14 DID release in October 2025, but it's supervised (Level 2), not unsupervised (Level 4)
- The landing page conflates the June 2025 robotaxi launch with October 2025 FSD v14 release
- This creates confusion about what actually happened and when

### Misleading Narrative Structure:

The landing page presents Tesla as having achieved unsupervised, Level 4 camera-only autonomous driving in October 2025. This is factually incorrect:
- Tesla launched limited robotaxi service in June 2025 (not October)
- Service operates with safety observers (not unsupervised)
- System remains Level 2 autonomy (not Level 4)
- Limited to 10-20 vehicles in geofenced area (not "at scale")

This misrepresentation undermines the credibility of the entire landing page.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Immediate Action Required:** Correct the October 2025/Level 4/unsupervised claims - these are factually wrong
2. **Remove Unverified Statistics:** 299% VC funding claim lacks any verifiable source
3. **Clarify Regulatory Requirements:** NHTSA assessments are voluntary, not required
4. **Tone Down Absolute Claims:** Use "estimated," "approximately," "reported" for unverified figures
5. **Add Sources:** Consider adding footnotes or references for key statistics
6. **Reconsider Narrative:** The current framing misleads readers about Tesla's actual autonomous driving capabilities as of October 2025
