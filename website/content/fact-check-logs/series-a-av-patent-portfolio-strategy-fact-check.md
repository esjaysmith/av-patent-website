### 🔴 ISSUE 2: Tesla FSD October 2025 - Temporal Logic Error

**Locations:** Lines 331, 463, 471

**Problem:**
- Document published: October 16, 2025
- Event claimed: "Tesla launched unsupervised FSD in Austin (October 2025)"

**Temporal Logic Issue:** Cannot observe "post-October 2025" trends in October 16, 2025 publication

**Verification Status:** ⚠️ UNVERIFIED - TEMPORAL CONTRADICTION
**Confidence:** LOW

**Required Action:**
1. Verify Tesla event actually occurred (provide specific date)
2. OR reframe as future projection/expected event
3. OR remove October 2025 specificity

**Verified By:** Agent 3
**Impact:** HIGH - Credibility issue
