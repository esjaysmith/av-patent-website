**Agent 3 Task:** Navigate to each URL and confirm it loads correctly. Document any broken links.

---

## Verification Workflow

### Step 1: Agent Launch (Parallel)

Launch all 3 agents simultaneously with prompts from `.agent/SOP/content_quality_assurance.md`:

- **Agent 1**: Patent Facts Verification
  - CRITICAL FIRST STEP: Read `.agent/System/patent_reference.md` from disk
  - Then read `.agent/US12001207B2.html` sections as needed
  - Verify all patent claims against local documentation

- **Agent 2**: Industry & Market Claims
  - Verify funding amounts, company data, market statistics
  - Use Crunchbase, official announcements, reputable news
  - Document all sources with publication dates

- **Agent 3**: Current Events & Dates
  - Verify Tesla FSD timeline, patent development timelines
  - Test all URLs for working links
  - Cross-check dates across multiple sources

### Step 2: Review Agent Findings

Categorize all findings:
- ✅ **VERIFIED**: Confirmed by primary source (no changes needed)
- ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED**: No primary source found (must remove or rephrase)
- ❌ **INCORRECT**: Factually wrong (must correct immediately)
- 🔍 **LOW CONFIDENCE**: Needs manual verification

### Step 3: Make Corrections

For each non-verified or incorrect claim:
1. Update content with accurate information or remove claim
2. Document correction in this log (see Corrections section below)
3. Re-run relevant agent on corrected section
4. Remove [VERIFY] tags once verified

### Step 4: Final Review

- Verify 100% of [VERIFY] tags resolved
- Ensure no claims remain unverified
- Calculate Source Quality Score (see below)
- Mark status as "READY FOR PUBLICATION"

---

## Source Quality Score

**Target:** >2.5 (mostly Tier 1 & Tier 2 sources)

**Formula:** (Tier 1 Sources × 3 + Tier 2 Sources × 2 + Tier 3 Sources × 1) ÷ Total Sources

**Tier Definitions:**
- **Tier 0**: `.agent/System/patent_reference.md` and `.agent/US12001207B2.html` (local files - ALWAYS use first)
- **Tier 1**: USPTO, Google Patents, official company announcements, SEC filings
- **Tier 2**: TechCrunch, Reuters, Bloomberg, Crunchbase, McKinsey reports
- **Tier 3**: General news, analyst blogs (require second source)

**Current Score:** [To be calculated after verification]
