**PARTIALLY VERIFIED (8 claims):**
- Tesla camera system cost <$1,000 (estimated, not officially confirmed) ⚠️
- VW-Mobileye uncertainty (exists but not specifically about LiDAR reassessment) ⚠️
- Chinese competitors camera-first (only XPeng fully committed, not all three) ⚠️
- NHTSA requirements (voluntary, not required) ⚠️
- Patent development costs (reasonable ranges but not officially sourced) ⚠️
- LiDAR economics threshold (logical but specific thresholds not sourced) ⚠️
- Patent acquisition premium 30-50% (general principle verified, specific percentage not sourced) ⚠️
- Patent litigation costs $3M-$10M (range not verified for AV sector specifically) ⚠️

**INCORRECT (1 claim):**
- Tesla FSD operates at Level 4 autonomy (actually Level 2) ❌

**UNVERIFIED (9 claims):**
- 299% VC funding increase for camera-first AV startups ❌
- Tesla holds "over 500" autonomous driving patents (number not verified) ❌
- 30-month delay creates "existential" disadvantage (strategic opinion) ⚠️
- Specific licensing fee range $100K-$300K (cannot verify without agreements) ⚠️

### Critical Corrections Required:

1. **PRIORITY 1 - Level 4 Autonomy Claim (Line 41):** Remove or correct claim that Tesla FSD operates at Level 4. Tesla FSD is Level 2 (supervised).

2. **PRIORITY 2 - Fleet Size Update (Line 59):** Change "over 5 million vehicles" to "over 6 million vehicles" per official Tesla sources (2025).

3. **PRIORITY 3 - Chinese Competitors (Line 79):** Specify that XPeng moved to camera-first, but NIO and Li Auto have not fully committed to camera-only approach.

4. **PRIORITY 4 - NHTSA Requirements (Line 116):** Change "requires" to "encourages" or note that safety self-assessments are voluntary.

5. **PRIORITY 5 - VW-Mobileye Partnership (Line 77):** Clarify that partnership was strengthened, not facing uncertainty. Uncertainty relates to VW's long-term dual-track strategy.

### Recommendations:

1. **Remove or source the 299% VC funding increase claim (Line 69)** - this specific statistic cannot be verified
2. **Add "estimated" qualifier to Tesla camera system cost** (<$1,000) or note Tesla pricing not publicly disclosed
3. **Remove or source the 30-50% acquisition premium percentage** - general principle is true, but specific percentage needs sourcing to specific AV study
4. **Consider removing specific patent litigation cost range** ($3M-$10M) or source it, or use "millions in legal fees"
5. **Verify Tesla's total autonomous driving patent count** before using "over 500"
6. **Soften LiDAR economics language** - add "industry analysts estimate" qualifier for specific thresholds
