# AV Patent Portfolio Due Diligence Guide for Venture Capital

## Executive Summary

Patent portfolio quality can influence 30-50% of autonomous vehicle startup valuation. *Based on industry reports and public market data. Actual results vary.* Strong IP portfolios reduce risk, validate investment theses, and drive higher acquisition multiples. This guide provides a systematic framework for evaluating AV patent portfolios during due diligence.

**Key Considerations:**
- Strong patent portfolios may positively influence valuation multiples compared to equivalent companies with weak IP
- Strategic acquirers explicitly value IP portfolios as significant components of acquisition value
- The industry's transition to camera-first technology requires new patent evaluation expertise
- Patent weaknesses discovered during exit due diligence can trigger 15-30% valuation reductions. *Based on industry reports and public market data. Actual results vary.*

**Critical Risks:**
- **Litigation Risk:** Patent infringement lawsuits drain capital from product development
- **Freedom-to-Operate Failures:** Product launches blocked by competitor patents
- **Weak Defensibility:** Competitors easily design around patents
- **Exit Impact:** IP gaps reduce acquisition valuations

**Valuation Impact by Stage:**
- Series A: Patent portfolio less critical (team and market matter more)
- Series B: Patent portfolio becomes critical (20-40% valuation impact)
- Series C+: Patent portfolio essential (30-50% valuation impact)

*Based on industry reports and public market data. Actual results vary.*

## IP Due Diligence Checklist for VCs

### Portfolio Size & Quality

**Portfolio Inventory (Request from Management):**
- [ ] Complete list of granted patents (numbers, grant dates, expiration dates)
- [ ] All pending patent applications (filing dates, application numbers, status)
- [ ] Provisional patent applications
- [ ] Patent families (international filings, continuations)
- [ ] Licensing agreements (in/out)
- [ ] Freedom-to-operate opinions
- [ ] Patent prosecution records

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- [ ] **Total Patents:** 10+ granted patents (Green) | 3-10 patents (Yellow) | <3 patents (Red)
- [ ] **Granted vs Pending:** 70%+ granted (Green) | 50% granted (Yellow) | 100% pending (Red)
- [ ] **Patent Age:** Multiple grants 3+ years (Green) | Mix 2-5 years (Yellow) | All <1 year (Red)
- [ ] **Patent Expiration:** 10+ years remaining (Green) | 5-10 years (Yellow) | <5 years (Red)
- [ ] **Technology Coverage:** 4+ areas (Green) | 2-3 areas (Yellow) | Single area (Red)

**Portfolio Company Screening Questions:**
- [ ] How many patents (granted vs pending vs provisional)?

- [ ] Have you conducted freedom-to-operate analysis? Findings?
- [ ] Have competitors contacted you regarding patent issues?
- [ ] Do you have licensed patents? What terms?
- [ ] What's your patent roadmap for next 12-24 months?
- [ ] How does your portfolio compare to Tesla, Waymo, Aurora?

### Freedom to Operate

**FTO Analysis Requirements (Essential for Series B+):**
- [ ] FTO analysis completed by reputable patent counsel ($50K-$100K investment)
- [ ] Search for competitor patents in relevant technology areas
- [ ] Claim-by-claim comparison to portfolio company's products
- [ ] Infringement risk assessment

- [ ] Competitor patents block key product features
- [ ] Management dismisses FTO concerns

**FTO Green Flags:**
- [ ] Documented FTO opinion from reputable counsel
- [ ] No identified freedom-to-operate issues
- [ ] Design-around options for borderline patents
- [ ] Active monitoring of competitor patents

### Technical Relevance

**Patent Quality Assessment:**
- [ ] **Claim Breadth:** Independent claims are broad (not narrow/easily designed around)
- [ ] **Prosecution Strength:** Fewer than 5 office action rejections
- [ ] **Minimal Claim Narrowing:** Claims didn't narrow significantly during prosecution
- [ ] **Prior Art Understanding:** Examiner's cited prior art reviewed and understood
- [ ] **Core Technology Coverage:** Patents cover actual products (not just theoretical)
- [ ] **Competitive Differentiation:** Patents protect innovations competitors can't easily design around
- [ ] **Future-Proofing:** Patents cover emerging technologies (E2E neural networks)
- [ ] **Licensing Value:** Competitors would want to license these patents

**Camera-First Patent Evaluation (Critical for AV Investments):**
- [ ] **Camera-Only Navigation:** Patent covers camera-only systems (not requiring LiDAR)

- [ ] Dismissive of FTO concerns
- [ ] Overconfidence about patent strength
- [ ] Lack of knowledge about basic patent details
- [ ] No patent strategy beyond "file when we can afford it"

### Strategic Value

**Competitive Landscape Assessment:**
- [ ] **Benchmark Understanding:** Portfolio compared to Tesla (500+ patents), Waymo (1,500+), Cruise
- [ ] **Technology-Specific Positioning:** Camera-first focus if targeting that market segment
- [ ] **Strategic Coverage:** Patents in critical areas where company plans to compete
- [ ] **Defensive Moat:** Patents prevent competitors from copying technology

**Patent Gap Analysis:**
- [ ] **Technology Gaps:** Identified areas lacking patent coverage vs competitors
- [ ] **Defensive Gaps:** Assessed vulnerability to competitor patent assertions
- [ ] **Offensive Opportunities:** Identified where company can assert patents
- [ ] **Strategic Licensing Needs:** Determined what patents company should license

**Critical Deal-Breaker Red Flags:**
- [ ] **Zero Patents:** No patents filed for Series B+ stage company
- [ ] **100% Pending Applications:** No granted patents in portfolio
- [ ] **Clear FTO Issues:** Freedom-to-operate analysis identifies infringement risks
- [ ] **Expiring Patents:** All patents expire within 5 years
- [ ] **No FTO Analysis:** Company hasn't conducted freedom-to-operate analysis

**Yellow Flags Requiring Mitigation:**
- [ ] **Narrow Claims:** Patents easily designed around by competitors

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How much should patent portfolio quality affect valuation?**

Strong patent portfolios typically warrant 30-50% valuation premiums. Context matters: Series A (team/market focus), Series B (20-40% IP impact), Series C+ (30-50% IP impact). *Based on industry reports and public market data. Actual results vary.*

**Q: Can we invest if patent portfolio is weak but fixable?**

Yes, but build patent strengthening into the investment plan: allocate 5-10% of capital to patent development/licensing, hire patent counsel in first 90 days, establish clear patent roadmap, track metrics quarterly.

**Q: What if portfolio company won't cooperate on patent due diligence?**

Major red flag indicating founder doesn't understand IP strategy importance, hidden patent issues, or disorganized IP management. Consider passing on deal or making IP cooperation a term sheet condition.

**Q: Should we always require FTO analysis?**

For Series B+ investments: Yes, absolutely ($50K-$100K prevents costly surprises). For Series A: Conditional—if technology touches areas where competitors hold patents (cameras, neural networks, object detection), conduct FTO analysis.
