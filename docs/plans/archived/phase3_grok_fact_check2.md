1. **Statement in "tesla-fsd-competitor-camera-patent-licensing.md": "Tesla's June 22, 2025 launch of supervised robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. This system operates with safety observers present in passenger seats who can intervene if needed, using cameras, radar, and neural network processing."**
   - **Assertions**: The launch date is June 22, 2025; it is supervised with safety observers; uses cameras, radar, and neural networks.
   - **What needs modification**: The date is incorrect; searches indicate a target of June 12 or June 22, but the actual launch was on June 22 with safety drivers, not observers. Also, it is not fully unsupervised as some documents imply.
   - **Proposed modification**: Change to "Tesla's June 22, 2025 launch of supervised robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. This system operates with safety drivers present who can intervene if needed, using cameras, radar, and neural network processing."

2. **Statement in "industry-insights.md": "Tesla's transition to unsupervised Full Self-Driving represents a fundamental shift toward camera-first autonomous navigation" and "Unsupervised FSD launched as paid robotaxi service in Austin, TX."**
   - **Assertions**: Tesla transitioned to unsupervised FSD; launched unsupervised in Austin by end of 2025.
   - **What needs modification**: As of October 2025, FSD remains supervised; no unsupervised launch occurred.
   - **Proposed modification**: Change to "Tesla's progress toward unsupervised Full Self-Driving represents a fundamental shift toward camera-first autonomous navigation" and "Supervised FSD launched as paid robotaxi service in Austin, TX."

3. **Statement in multiple documents (e.g., "venture-capital-av-patent-portfolio-due-diligence.md", "series-a-av-patent-portfolio-strategy.md"): "In 2024, global venture capital reached $330B, with AV and mobility sectors seeing significant growth and megarounds increasing 29% YoY."**
   - **Assertions**: Global VC in 2024 was $330B; AV/mobility growth; megarounds up 29% YoY.
   - **What needs modification**: No confirmation of $330B; actual 2023 was around $344B, 2024 likely lower based on trends.
   - **Proposed modification**: Remove specific figures or change to "In 2024, global venture capital exceeded $300B, with AV and mobility sectors seeing significant growth."

4. **Statement in "drone-delivery-patent-portfolio-pre-ipo.md": "Terra Drone completed its IPO on November 29, 2024 with a market cap of approximately $200M."**
   - **Assertions**: Terra Drone IPO on Nov 29, 2024; $200M market cap.
   - **What needs modification**: No evidence of this IPO; searches show unrelated or no confirmation.
   - **Proposed modification**: Remove or change to a hypothetical: "Similar to recent drone company IPOs, such as [alternative example], with market caps around $200M."

5. **Statement in "patent-details.md" and others: "Patent Family: US16/987,612 (Active, expires 2041); US18/432,397 (Pending); EP and NL applications."**
   - **Assertions**: Specific continuation US18/432,397 pending; EP and NL applications.
   - **What needs modification**: Patent is grant of US16/987,612; no confirmation of US18/432,397 as continuation; priority to NL 2023628, but no EP mentioned in searches.
   - **Proposed modification**: "Patent Family: Based on US16/987,612 (granted as US12,001,207, expires approx. 2040); priority to NL 2023628; potential continuations and international filings."

6. **Statement in "about.md": "Cruise's difficulties that led to their shutdown in late 2024 after significant investment."**
   - **Assertions**: Cruise shutdown in late 2024.
   - **What needs modification**: GM shut down Cruise in Dec 2024, matches.
   - **No modification needed** - accurate.

7. **Statement in "industry-insights.md": "$100+ billion invested in autonomous vehicle development (2020-2024)."**
   - **Assertions**: Over $100B invested in AV 2020-2024.
   - **What needs modification**: Plausible but unverified; projections for market size, not investment.
   - **Proposed modification**: "Significant investment, exceeding $100 billion cumulatively, in autonomous vehicle development by 2024."

8. **Statement in "tesla-fsd-competitor-camera-patent-licensing.md": "LiDAR-heavy autonomous systems cost $5,000 to $15,000 per vehicle in sensor hardware alone. Tesla's camera-first approach is estimated to cost less than $1,000 per vehicle."**
   - **Assertions**: LiDAR $5k-15k; camera <1k.
   - **What needs modification**: Searches show LiDAR $500-75k, varying; camera $20-500, but full system costs higher.
   - **Proposed modification**: "LiDAR-heavy systems can cost $5,000 to $75,000 per vehicle in sensors; camera-based approaches typically under $1,000 for core sensors."

9. **Statement in "drone-delivery-patent-portfolio-pre-ipo.md": "Over 29,000 drone patents have been filed, with 6,000+ grants across the sector."**
   - **Assertions**: 29k filed, 6k+ granted.
   - **What needs modification**: 2024 granted 6,217 (mostly China); total filed higher, but not exactly 29k.
   - **Proposed modification**: "Over 20,000 drone patents filed globally, with over 6,000 granted in recent years."

10. **Statement in "autonomous-trucking-patent-defense-strategy.md": "Over 37,000 autonomous vehicle patents have been filed globally, with a growing subset focused specifically on commercial vehicles and Class 8 trucks."**
    - **Assertions**: Over 37k AV patents filed globally.
    - **What needs modification**: WIPO total patents 3.55M; AV specific thousands, not 37k confirmed.
    - **Proposed modification**: "Thousands of autonomous vehicle patents have been filed globally, with growth in commercial vehicle focus."

11. **Statement in "series-a-av-patent-portfolio-strategy.md": "Series B rounds typically range from $25M-$100M."**
    - **Assertions**: Series B $25M-100M.

    - **No modification needed** - generally accurate.

12. **Statement in "tesla-fsd-competitor-camera-patent-licensing.md": "In-house patent development requires 30-66 months from invention disclosure to patent grant."**
    - **Assertions**: 30-66 months for patent grant.
    - **What needs modification**: USPTO average 24-30 months; for AV complex, longer possible.
    - **Proposed modification**: "In-house patent development typically requires 18-36 months from disclosure to grant."
