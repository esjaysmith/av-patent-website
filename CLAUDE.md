# DOCUMENTATION

We maintain all essential documents in the `.agent` folder, ensuring they are regularly updated with the structure outlined below:

.agent
- Tasks: Product Requirements Document (PRD) and implementation plans for each feature
- System: Detailed documentation of the current system state (including project structure, technology stack, integration points, database schema, and core functionalities such as agent architecture and LLM layer, etc.)
- SOP: Best practices for executing specific tasks (e.g., how to implement a schema migration, how to add a new page route, etc.)
- README.md: An index of all documentation to help users understand what is available and where to find it

We must consistently update the `.agent` documentation after implementing new features to ensure it accurately reflects the most current information.

Before planning any implementation, always review the `.agent/README.md` first to gain proper context.
